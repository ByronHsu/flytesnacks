    "`@vscode` simplifies converting a Python task into a Visual Studio Code server, enabling connection and debugging in remote environments. It supports installing various extensions for development assistance, including Copilot, Python, or Jupyter. FlyIn enhances this by automatically generating scripts for task execution, using inputs from previous tasks or resuming with updated code. Additionally, FlyIn offers numerous advanced features, as detailed in the \"Advanced Usage\" section."

    "\n",

    "1. **(Recommended)** Set up ingress on the backend to expose a URL on the Flyte console. Details are to be determined (TBD).\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   $ kubectl port-forward <pod name> <port>\n",

It's important to note that the task runs entirely within VSCode and does not write the output to Flyte storage.\n",
